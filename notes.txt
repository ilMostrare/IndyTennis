Coinflip/Walkover - Min for winner, no show = 0?

SOS/RPI?

***How is the current mailing list handled?  
 - The link on the website just sends me an email telling me someone is Interested and I then add their email to our list, which is actually 4 lists because our email server only lets me send email to 49 people at a time. Eye roll

**How do you want to handle entering matchups?  
 - Ideally it would auto generate, as the excel spreadsheet already does for me. (But then I do tinker with it to avoid repeat matches)

***How do you want to handle score entering?  
 - Idk if I trust people to enter their own scores
