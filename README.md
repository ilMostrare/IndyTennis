This site replaces free WordPress site that was in use. Functions as an informational site for non-members, and, as of March 1st, 2019, will host the organization's yearly singles, doubles, team doubles tennis ladder for roughly 100 players.

Singles ladder: Each round, the site will assign each person an opponent, players then have 2 weeks to contact the opponent, schedule, and play the match. Points are awarded regardless of win or loss, but number of points awarded varies dependent on win or loss and difficulty of opponent. Challenge matches can be played (player chooses opponent within 5 of their rank on their own, same point calculation but /3)

Doubles ladder: Each round, the site will assign each person 3 opponents, players then have 1 month to contact the opponents, schedule, and play the match. Matches are to be played as 1 set with each person as a partner. Points are awarded regardless of win or loss. Players move up and down the ladder individually.

Doubles ladder: Players start the season with their chosen partner and keep the same partner all season. Each round, the site will assign each person an opponent team, players then have 1 month to contact the opponents, schedule, and play the match. Matches are to be played as 1 set with each person as a partner. Points are awarded regardless of win or loss. Players move up and down the ladder with their partner.
